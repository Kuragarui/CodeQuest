Keeper of Decisions: I guard the paths of choice. Which keyword checks a condition in Python?
- if => correct
- conditional => wrong
- check => wrong

~ correct

Keeper of Decisions: Correct! The 'if' statement controls the flow of your code.
=> END

~ wrong

Keeper of Decisions: Wrong! Python uses 'if' to check conditions, not other keywords.
=> END
